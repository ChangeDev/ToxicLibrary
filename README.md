## About
Commando is the official command framework for [discord.js](https://github.com/discordjs/discord.js).
It is flexible, fully object-oriented, easy to use, and makes it trivial to create your own powerful commands.
Additionally, it makes full use of ES2017's `async`/`await` functionality for clear, concise code that is simple to write and easy to comprehend.
